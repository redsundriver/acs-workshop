[#vulnerability_management_panel]
== Vulnerability Management main panel

Letâ€™s start with Vulnerability Management, a familiar topic for most security teams.

The overview provides several important reports - where the vulnerabilities are, which are the most widespread or the most recent, where my container images are coming from, and important vulnerabilities in OpenShift itself.

[#image_overview_image_details]
== Identifying vulnerable images

In this example we're going to identify container images that are vulnerable to a critical CVE - Log4Shell. Log4Shell is a critical vulnerability in the Java log4j logging framework. It is trivial to exploit this vulnerability, and essential that we can identify vulnerable applications.

Select 'Images' in the Vulnerability Management navbar to search for vulnerable images.

image::vulnerabilities/41_vuln.png[ACS vulnerable image search, 800]

In the search bar type 'CVE' and hit 'enter' to search images by CVE. Enter one of the CVE identifiers for Log4Shell - 'CVE-2021-44228'. When you hit enter again you will be shown all of the vulnerable container images across the environment that are vulnerable to Log4Shell.

There's some important information that we can pull from this view:

* We can see that there is a single container vulnerable to Log4Shell across any of the Kubernetes environments that are being managed - 'quay.io/smileyfritz/log4shell-app:v0.5'.
* This container has 103 identified CVEs, 87 of which are fixable
* The container was created 16 Feb, 2022 and is based on Alpine OS.

The image is listed as 'Active', meaning that is associated with a Kubernetes deployment in one of the secured clusters. If you select 'deployments', you will be able to see where this image is deployed.

Ok, we know that this image is in the production cluster, in the DevOps namespace, and the deployment is named 'log4shell-app'.

== Image CVE Analysis

Let's dive a bit deeper into this image. We know that's vulnerable to Log4Shell, so let's see how this vulnerability was introduced.

Navigate back to the image search, and click the image name - 'quay.io/smileyfritz/log4shell-app:v0.5'.

image::vulnerabilities/44_vuln.png[ACS image analysis, 800]

This page provides more information about the container image that can be used by the security team to assess risk:

* There are five critical CVEs present in this container image
* The riskiest components are **OpenJDK** (73 CVEs, all of which are fixable), **Tomcat** (16 CVEs, none that can be fixed), **log4j** (Four CVEs, all of which are fixable), **jackson-databind** (three CVEs, all of which are fixable), and **libpng** (also three CVEs, all of which are fixable). There's certainly a lot of fixable CVEs here!

Select the **log4j** component and we can see more information about the CVEs introduced into this image.

image::vulnerabilities/45_vuln.png[ACS log4shell analysis, 800]

We can see that this particular CVE - CVE-2021-44228 - is patched in log4j-core 2.15.0. But, we should probably update to log4j-core 2.17.1 to mitigate other critical and moderate CVEs.

Navigate back to the image overview and expand the 'Dockerfile' section. This shows the different layers present in this container image, and when specific CVEs were introduced.

image::vulnerabilities/46_vuln.png[ACS Dockerfile, 800]

We can find some more information in this view:

* This container image is using a very old base image, dating back to 2018 (!).
* Most of the CVEs were introduced during the JVM installation (OpenJDK 8) into the container image
* The Log4Shell CVEs were introduced in the final step of the container image build, copying the Spring Boot application into the container image

We now have the information we need to work with this team. 

[#scanning_images]
== Scanning images for vulnerabilities

By default information about vulnerabilities is show for all the images:

* Active images, which are those images that are deployed.
* Inactive images, which are those images that are not deployed.

image::vulnerabilities/active_inactive.png[ActiveInactive, 700]

Only active images will be scanned for vulnerabilities. If we want to scan inactive images we will need to mark the image as watched, so you will need to click on **Manage Watches**:

image::vulnerabilities/01-inactive.png[ActiveInactive, 700]

Add the inactive image you want to scan for vulnerabilities:
